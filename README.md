# Detection-and-Counting-Vehicles-using-OpenCV
In this project, we will be coding a vehicle counting and detection system. It will be enough to work for both the images or the video, for the same, we will be using OpenCV for doing all the image processing operations and for classification the car and bus HAAR cascade classifier for detecting and counting the cars and buses.
